        <p>Hi, I'm Jamie! I'm a student developer with a large assortment of interests and skills! I got my start when I was about 16, creating games for fun using Construct 3. I continued making games ever since, but kept finding myself wanting to learn how to make software. Now, I'm proud to say I'm a fast learning developer! Go ahead and check out some of my work below, and feel free to contact me.</p>
