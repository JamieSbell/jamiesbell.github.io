# Custom-Homepage
This is a simple WIP homepage for browsers that I'm working on. Create categories and icons with links to your favorite sites!

This isn't anything too crazy, but it is my first decently functional project built off of the stuff I've learned over the last few weeks. 

So far, I’ve only added some basic functionality for adding shortcuts and categories for bookmarks, but this is supposed to be a customizable browser homepage. I’ve been inspired to create this since I started looking for custom homepages and came up disappointed. The best thing I tried was a browser extension for Firefox called Bonjour, but I wanted to embed my Todoist tasks into it, adjust the layout with more freedom, and add some animations to the backgrounds. I’m quite far from the end goal, but this has been something I’ve been fixated on for months, so I don’t mind having this as a project to tinker away on.

Some of the stuff I’m working on are:

- Uploading custom backgrounds.
- Having a random background load when the page is loaded.
- A basic settings modal to fine tune things.
- UI for managing bookmarks and categories after they’re made.
- Making sure things update instantly / general UI/UX improvements.

Note to my fellow class mates:

I want to mention that I have years of experience programming browser games, so please don’t compare where you’re at to where I’m at if you don’t think you could do something like this yet. For the most part, I understand a lot of the problem solving, project scoping, and logic to be able to make things like this. It’s taking me some time to learn how to do this stuff with JS, but I understand most of the underlying ideas and terms already. Also, I have a ton of free time since I don’t have kids and my husband and I just work on stuff all the time out of passion. I’m a huge nerd for anything tech or art related and have been since 7th grade.

I would appreciate any feedback and I’m happy to answer any questions that I’m capable of. I built a lot of this functionality myself, besides the accordion and modal stuff from Bootstrap.
